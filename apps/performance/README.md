# Performance

This app is meant to track the performance of the application (memory, parse rate) to fine-tune performance.

## Usage

Two terminals/shells:

1. Build the app with update on save: `npm run start-perf`

2. Run performance with `npm run perf` (this adds flags to emulate the start from our language server)
