**4.0.0 is here!**

This release headlines our newest feature: IDL Notebooks! The IDL Notebook format is standalone and only requires this extension to function (no extra dependencies on Python or Jupyter).

Within the extension, you'll find a new sidebar entry to help create a new notebook, open IDL and ENVI Notebook examples, and convert your IDL Notebooks to a PRO file as well. If you have questions, feel free to reach out to us on GitHub with any feedback or issues you encounter.

In addition to this, we have revamped our tools for styling/formatting your code to include other case styles like pascal and camel case.

That's not all that is included in this release, so check out the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

> If you are looking to contribute, or get your development environment setup, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

---

This extension adds syntax highlighting, code snippets, debugging, problem reporting (undefined variables and syntax errors, 100+ in total!), IDL Notebooks, and much more for the Interactive Data Language (IDL) from NV5 Geospatial Software (formerly Research Systems, Inc.).

For a full list of changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for lots of details.

## Features

- A full-featured IDL code editor, with variable type detection, auto complete, chromacoding, problem reporting, and code formatting

- Does not require IDL to be installed to write/edit code. IDL is only required when debugging/running code or using IDL Notebooks.

- An integrated debugger with breakpoints, or run command-line IDLÂ within the VS Code terminal

- Native support IDL Notebooks with embedded graphics and save to PDF (this is from VSCode, does not require Python)

- Hover help contains the complete documentation for ENVI and IDL, including examples that you can open in IDL Notebooks.

- Create routine-definition documentation for routines within SAVE files or DLMs

- Support for internationalization

  - Submit a bug/feature for adding languages. Hopefully they are for a language that you speak, so you could also help with the translation :)

## IDL and ENVI Requirement

Using the "debug" sessions of IDL requires that you have a version of IDL with lists, hashes, and orderedhashes (and the ability to parse/serialize JSON).

The extension is tested against:

- IDL 8.9

- IDL 9.0

Anything else is use-at-your-own-risk and may not work.

Notebooks have specific version requirements for IDL and ENVI:

- For IDL, you'll need IDL 8.8.0 or newer (enforced, and checked, when notebooks start)

- For ENVI, you'll need ENVI 6.0 or ENVI 5.7. Any other version of ENVI is not guaranteed to work.

## Known Issues

- Not an issue, but structure definitions are _only_ found in procedures that end with "\_\_define" following IDL's standard. If you define structures anywhere else, they will not be detected and you'll see a error regarding unknown structures.

- By default, the language server that parses your IDL code is limited to about 1.5 million lines of code. If you notice that the extension is running out of memory (language server crashes), one workaround is to install "node.js" and ensure that it is on your system path.

  When the IDL extension starts, if it finds node.js on your path, it will automatically start the language server using node, which should remove this limitation. If you still see memory errors, then reach out to us on GitHub and let us know.

  To install node.js, get the latest v18 release from https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases.

- As a part of the code that we parse, we also do our best to statically determine types and do type checking. If you notice issues with type checks being wrong, or there are incorrectly documented routines, let us know!

- The debugger is back and has some improvements. However, this is still a pre-release version of the ability to interactively run IDL code. For the next IDL release in late 2023 we are hoping to have this dramatically improved. Here's a few important things to know:

  - Pausing is not supported on Windows, this will hopefully be resolved in the near future. Currently it kills the IDL process and is being worked on.

  - If you find reproduce cases where syntax errors are not appearing, or are not going away, please file a bug report.

  - If syntax errors are not going away then you can: reset IDL, restart IDL, stop and start IDL again and they will disappear.

  - You may occasionally see some text that is printed to the console when IDL is running, this is a known bug that happens for a few rare cases and can be ignored.

- Icon theme:

  - The icon theme is directly from [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/theme-seti) and only modified to use a different icon for PRO files (use our own instead of the prolog owl icon). Credits and auxiliary files can be found in `./extension/icon-theme`.

- Syntax highlighting

  - Legacy highlighting theme based on Mike Galloy's [idl.tmbundle](https://github.com/mgalloy/idl.tmbundle). Has since been completely rewritten as YAML and following other patterns/different regular expressions, but some roots are still there.

- Icons

  - The icons used in VSCode either come from Material Icons (Google via npm "material-icons") or Material Design (Templarian via npm "@mdi/js")

  - PDF icon is from "Material Icon Theme"

- PDF Generation

  - We use a 3rd party extension called "Markdown PDF" to create PDFs

  - Credit goes to [yzane](https://github.com/yzane/vscode-markdown-pdf/tree/master) as the creator of this extension

## Usage Metrics

The IDL extension for VSCode collects anonymous usage data on the extension. The goal of this information is to improve the overall experience, focus development on tools that users work with the most, and make sure our software can run on the average user's hardware.

> IDL for VSCode uses the VSCode root preference for telemetry (`telemetry.telemetryLevel`) as an indicator if we should send usage metrics or not.
>
> To disable reporting usage metrics for VSCode, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry#_disable-telemetry-reporting) for more information.

To learn more about what we collect and why, view our [USAGE_METRICS](./extension/docs/general/USAGE_METRICS.md) guide.
