# IDL and ENVI Notebooks

One of the coolest features of Visual Studio code is that it natively supports notebooks.

If you are new to notebooks, they are:

- Easy for doing ad-hoc programming

- A great way to organize your logic and thought process intermixed with code blocks and results

- A way that you can share code with your colleagues and friends

::: tip
With the latest release of VSCode, you can now pop open notebooks in separate windows.

All notebooks share the same instance of IDL behind the scenes, so you can only run one at a time with the current implementation.

If you are interested in being able to run more than one notebook at a time, let us know on GitHub and we can take a look!
