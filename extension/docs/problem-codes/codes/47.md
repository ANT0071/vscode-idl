This problem occurs when argument definitions are found after keywords (optional parameters).

Here's an example of this error:

```idl{1,2}
function myfunc, kw = kw, arg1
  ;                       ^^^^ args first
  compile_opt idl2
  return,1
end
```

Which can be fixed by reducing to a single statment:

```idl{1,2}
function myfunc, arg1, kw = kw
  ;              ^^^^ OK!
  compile_opt idl2
  return,1
end
```
