::: info Documentation Best Practice
This problem indicates that there's an opportunity to improve the documentation for your code.

This helps make sure the extension can properly detect types, provide a better user experience, and ensures other users can be successful with code that you write.

This error occurs when you have a function with documentation, but no documentation for the type that gets returned from the function

Here's an example that produces this error:

```idl{1,2,3}
;+
; Code block with description
;-
function myfunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```

To fix it, add in the `:Returns:` docs tag:

```idl{4}
;+
; Code block with description
;
; :Returns: Number
;-
function myfunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```
