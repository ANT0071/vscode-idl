# IDL Problem Code `38` with alias `no-comp-opt`

::: danger Best Practice
For modern IDL programming, `compile_opt idl2` is a must to help prevent common mistakes and normalize how people should write their IDL code.

IDL for VSCode automatically detects this problem and will fix it for you if configured.
:::

Here's an example of how to reproduce the error:

```idl
pro myPro
; ^^^^^^^ missing compile_opt idl2
  ; ... logic

end
```

Which you can fix by adding in `compile_opt`:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2

  ; ... logic

end
```
