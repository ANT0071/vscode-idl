This error is reported when your documentation is missing the `:Keywords:` tag when a routine definition has keywords.

Here's an example:

```idl{1,2,3}
;+
;
;-
pro myclass::mymethod, kw1 = kw1
  compile_opt idl2
end
```

To fix it, add the `:Keywords:` section to the documentation:

```idl{2,3,4}
;+
; :Keywords:
;   kw1: bidirectional, optional, any
;     Placeholder docs for argument, keyword, or property
;
;-
pro myclass::mymethod, kw1 = kw1
  compile_opt idl2
end
```
