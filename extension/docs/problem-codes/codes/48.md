::: info Documentation Best Practice
This problem indicates that there's an opportunity to improve the documentation for your code.

This helps make sure the extension can properly detect types, provide a better user experience, and ensures other users can be successful with code that you write.

This error is reported when your documentation is missing the `:Arguments:` tag when a routine definition has arguments.

Here's an example:

```idl{1,2,3}
;+
;
;-
pro myclass::mymethod, var1
  compile_opt idl2
end
```

To fix it, add the `:Arguments:` section to the documentation:

```idl{2,3,4}
;+
; :Arguments:
;   var1: bidirectional, required, any
;     Placeholder docs for argument, keyword, or property
;
;-
pro myclass::mymethod, var1
  compile_opt idl2
end
```
