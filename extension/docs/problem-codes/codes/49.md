# IDL Problem Code `49` with alias `no-args-to-doc`

::: info Documentation Best Practice
This problem indicates that there's an opportunity to improve the documentation for your code.

This helps make sure the extension can properly detect types, provide a better user experience, and ensures other users can be successful with code that you write.

This error is reported when your documentation contains arguments, but you don't have any in your routine definition.

Here's an example:

```idl{4,5,6}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;
; :Arguments:
;   arg1: in, required, Number
;     My favorite arg
;
;-
function myfunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```

To fix it, either remove the comments or add the argument

::: code-group

```idl{9} [Fix: Add Argument]
;+
; :Returns: Number
;
; :Arguments:
;   arg1: in, required, Number
;     My favorite arg
;
;-
function myfunc, arg1
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42 + arg1
end
```

```idl [Fix: Remove Docs]
;+
; :Returns: Number
;-
function myfunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```
