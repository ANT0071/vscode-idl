# IDL Problem Code `68` with alias `expected-statement`

::: danger Execution Error
This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling or running code
:::

This identifies when there should be additional code, but none is found. Here are a few examples:

```idl
a =
   ; ^^ should be something to assign
```

```idl
a = 40 +
       ; ^^ should be something to add
```

```idl
for i=0,42 do
             ; ^^ should be something to do
```
