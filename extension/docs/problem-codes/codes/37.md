# IDL Problem Code `37` with alias `reserved-func-method`

::: danger Warning
Potentially fatal error depending if the internal routine is written in PRO code or in core IDL/ENVI
:::

If you have a function method definition that conflicts with a core IDL definition, this gets reported.

```idl
function list::where
       ; ^^^^^^^^^^^ problem
  return, 1
end
```

To correct, rename your method as something else.

```idl
function list::myWhere
  return, 1
end
```
