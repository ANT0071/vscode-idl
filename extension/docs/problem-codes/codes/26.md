# IDL Problem Code `26` with alias `duplicate-func-method`

> Potentially causes inconsistencies when IDL is running code, depending on your search path and the order of folders

This identifies user-defined function methods that have more than one definition present.

Note that IDL is case insensitive when resolving routines and, once a routine is compiled or on IDL's search path, it can be accessed from anywhere.

````idl
function myClass::myMethod
  ;      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ duplicate function

  ; ... logic here

  return, 1
end

```idl
function myClass::myMethod
  ;      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ duplicate function

  ; ... logic here

  return, 1
end
````

To fix, change the name of your routine:

````idl
```idl
function myClass::myMethod1
  ; ... logic here

  return, 1
end

```idl
function myClass::myMethod2
  ; ... logic here

  return, 1
end
````
