# IDL Problem Code `26` with alias `duplicate-func-method`

::: warning Warning
Potentially causes inconsistencies when IDL is running code, depending on your search path and the order in which routines are found and compiled
:::

This identifies user-defined function methods that have more than one definition present.

Note that IDL is case insensitive when resolving routines and, once a routine is compiled or on IDL's search path, it can be accessed from anywhere.

```idl{1,2,6,7}
function myClass::myMethod
  ;      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ duplicate function
  return, 1
end

function myClass::myMethod
  ;      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ duplicate function
  return, 1
end
```

To fix, change the name of your routines:

```idl{1,5}
function myClass::myMethod1
  return, 1
end

function myClass::myMethod2
  return, 1
end
```
