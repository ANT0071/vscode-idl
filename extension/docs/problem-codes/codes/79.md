This issue detects when a structure definition is missing from the documentation for the procedure it is contained in.

Here is an example of the problem:

```idl{7,8}
;+
;
;-
pro MyStruct__define
  compile_opt idl2

  void = {MyStruct, prop1: '', prop2: 42}
  ;       ^^^^^^^^ missing from docs
end
```

Which can be fixed by adding the structure to the docs:

```idl{2,3,4,5,6}
;+
; :MyStruct:
;   prop1: string
;     First property
;   prop2: Number
;     Second property
;
;-
pro MyStruct__define
  compile_opt idl2

  void = {MyStruct, prop1: '', prop2: 42}
  ;       ^^^^^^^ OK!
end
```
