# IDL Problem Code `65` with alias `string-literal-too-many-args`

::: danger Execution Error
This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling or running code
:::

This error occurs when you pass in too many arguments for formatting content to be added to a string literal (template literal).

This error happens when you have code like this:

```idl
mystring = `${1.234, abc, "%10.3f"}`
```

And can be fixed by removing the additional argument:

```idl
mystring = `${1.234, "%10.3f"}`
```
