::: info Documentation Best Practice
This problem indicates that there's an opportunity to improve the documentation for your code.

This helps make sure the extension can properly detect types, provide a better user experience, and ensures other users can be successful with code that you write.

This problem indicates that the documentation for a parameter (argument or keyword) has too many pieces of information that we don't understand.

By default, we accept the direction, if the parameter is required or optional, the data type, and if it is private or not (optional).

Here's an example that highlights the problem:

```idl{5}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;
; :Arguments:
;   arg: in, required, Number, private, meaningOfLife
;     My favorite arg
;
;-
function myfunc, arg
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42 + arg
end
```

To fix the issue, remove the additional docs parameters

```idl{5}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;
; :Arguments:
;   arg: in, required, Number, private
;     My favorite arg
;
;-
function myfunc, arg
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42 + arg
end
```
