# IDL Problem Code `43` with alias `expected-comma`

::: danger Execution Error
This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling or running code
:::

This problem catches when your IDL syntax isn't quite right and theres supposed to be a comma after a statement.

```idl
pro myPro arg
  ;      ^ expected comma
  compile_opt idl2
  print, arg
end
```

To fix, add in the missing comma:

```idl
pro myPro, arg
  compile_opt idl2
  print, arg
end
```
