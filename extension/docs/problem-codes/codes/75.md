# IDL Problem Code `75` with alias `duplicate-kw-usage`

::: danger Execution Error
This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling or running code
:::

This problem detects when a keyword is used more than once when calling a routine.

Here is an example of this problem:

```idl
p = plot(/test, /test)
;        ^^^^^  ^^^^^  duplicate structure tag
```

Fix this problem by reducing to a single keyword instance:

```idl
p = plot(/test)
;        ^^^^^  OK!
```
