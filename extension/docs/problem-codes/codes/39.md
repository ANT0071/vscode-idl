# IDL Problem Code `39` with alias `no-idl2`

For modern IDL programming, `compile_opt idl2` is a must to help prevent common mistakes and normalize how people should write their IDL code.

Here's an example of how to reproduce the error:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt hidden
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ missing idl2

  ; ... logic

end
```

Which you can fix by adding in `idl2` as a compile opt:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2, hidden

  ; ... logic

end
```
