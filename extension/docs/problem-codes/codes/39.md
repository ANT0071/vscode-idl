# IDL Problem Code `39` with alias `no-idl2`

::: danger Best Practice
For modern IDL programming, `compile_opt idl2` is a must to help prevent common mistakes and normalize how people should write their IDL code.

IDL for VSCode automatically detects this problem and will fix it for you if configured.

Here's an example of how to reproduce the error:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt hidden
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ missing idl2

  ; ... logic

end
```

Which you can fix by adding in `idl2` as a compile opt:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2, hidden

  ; ... logic

end
```
