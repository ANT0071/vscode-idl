# IDL Problem Code `23` with alias `duplicate-pro`

> Potentially causes inconsistencies when IDL is running code, depending on your search path and the order of folders

This identifies user-defined procedures that have more than one definition present.

Note that IDL is case insensitive when resolving routines and, once a routine is compiled or on IDL's search path, it can be accessed from anywhere.

Here is an example of problem code and how to fix it:

```idl
pro myPro
  ; ^^^^^ duplicate procedure

  ; ... logic here
end

pro myPro
  ; ^^^^^ duplicate procedure

  ; ... logic here
end
```

To fix, change the name of your routine:

```idl
pro myPro1
  ; ... logic here
end

pro myPro2
  ; ... logic here
end
```
