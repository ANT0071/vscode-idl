::: info Documentation Best Practice
This problem indicates that there's an opportunity to improve the documentation for your code.

This helps make sure the extension can properly detect types, provide a better user experience, and ensures other users can be successful with code that you write.

This problem indicates that the `:Return:` tag in documentation does not have any text indicating the type that gets returned.

Here's an example that produces this error:

```idl{2}
;+
; :Returns:
;-
function myfunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```

To fix it, add a type to the `:Returns:` docs tag:

```idl{2}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;-
function myfunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```
