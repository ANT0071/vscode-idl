This problem indicates that the documentation for a parameter (argument or keyword) does not have our three required pieces of information.

Here's an example that highlights the problem:

```idl{5}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;
; :Arguments:
;   arg:
;     My favorite arg
;
;-
function myfunc, arg
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42 + arg
end
```

To fix the issue, add in the direction, if the parameter is required or not, and the data type:

```idl{5}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;
; :Arguments:
;   arg: in, required, Number
;     My favorite arg
;
;-
function myfunc, arg
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42 + arg
end
```
