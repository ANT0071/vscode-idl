# IDL Problem Code `34` with alias `empty-main`

::: danger Execution Error
This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling or running code

If you have a main level program, it cannot be empty.

```idl
; main level

end
```

To correct, add something else:

```idl
; main level
meaningOfLife = 42
end
```
