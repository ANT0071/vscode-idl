This error occurs when there are more than one `compile_opt` statements in a routine or main level program.

Here's an example of this error:

```idl{2,3,4}
function myfunc
  compile_opt idl2
  compile_opt hidden
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ multiple compile opts
  return,1
end
```

Which can be fixed by reducing to a single statment:

```idl{2,3}
function myfunc
  compile_opt idl2, hidden
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
  return,1
end
```
