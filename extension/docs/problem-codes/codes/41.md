# IDL Problem Code `41` with alias `empty-comp-opt`

::: danger Execution Error
This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling or running code
:::

This issue detects when you have a `compile_opt` statement that has no compile options.

Here's an example of how to reproduce the error:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt
  ; ^^^^^^^^^ empty compile opt

  ; ... logic

end
```

To fix, add any compile option to the list (preferably `idl2`):

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2

  ; ... logic

end
```
