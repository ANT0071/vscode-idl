# IDL Problem Code `30` with alias `reserved-func`

> Potentially fatal error depending if the internal routine is written in PRO code or in core IDL/ENVI

This identifies when user-defined functions match the same name as routines internal to IDL.

Here's an example:

```idl
function label_region
  ; ^^^^^^ reserved function

  ; ... logic

  return, 1
end
```

To fix, change the name of your routine:

```idl
function my_label_region
  ; ... logic

  return, 1
end
```
