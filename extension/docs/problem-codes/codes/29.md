# IDL Problem Code `29` with alias `reserved-pro`

::: danger Warning
Potentially fatal error depending if the internal routine is written in PRO code or in core IDL/ENVI
:::

This identifies when user-defined procedures match the same name as routines internal to IDL.

Here's an example:

```idl
pro writeu
  ; ^^^^^^ reserved procedure

  ; ... logic
end
```

To fix, change the name of your routine:

```idl
pro myWriteU
  ; ... logic
end
```
