# Problem Codes: Configuration

Each problem code can be manually disabled if desired.

> Any problems you disable do not require a restart of Visual Studio Code. The reported problems should update fairly quickly and you should see changes almost immediately.

## Disable Documentation Errors

Because documentation errors represent many problem codes, you can turn them all off with a single setting.

To do this:

1. Navigate to the IDL Sidebar

2. Near the bottom of the sidebar, select "Open Extension Settings"

3. Select the group "Problem Reporting"

4. Turn off "Report Docs Problems"

## Disable Single Codes

To disable a problem code:

1. Navigate to the IDL Sidebar

2. Near the bottom of the sidebar, select "Open Extension Settings"

3. Select the group "Problem Reporting"

4. Add new entries to "Ignore Problems" for each problem code that you want disabled
