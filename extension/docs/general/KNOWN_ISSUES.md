# Known Issues

This document covers some of the known issues with the extension and how to work around them.

## Notebooks

- If you try to view the output from a notebook cell in a text editor, and see an error along the lines of "unable to resolve text editor content", there is a setting you can change in VSCode for it to load correctly.

  You'll need to make sure the setting "Workbench -> Settings: Open Default Settings" is enabled with a check box.

  You may need to close and re-open the editor to have the changes take effect.

  We enable this by default for the extension as it gives a better user experience overall. But, if you changed it, that is why we document it.
