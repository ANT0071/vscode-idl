# Documenting Your Code

Some of the core features of the extension revolve around parsing the comments in your code to learn about types and directions of your parameters.

The extension has build-in capabilities to automatically format, and add documentation to your code, when you save.

This feature helps you get the most out of the code that you write and makes it easier for others to interpret, and use, your code.
